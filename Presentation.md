Our Event Ticket Booking application was built with a focus on user experience, responsive design, and ease of use. It allows users to explore upcoming events, view quick previews, and purchase tickets with an interactive UI powered by Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.


📌  Key Features
 Modern responsive design with Tailwind CSS
 Interactive modals and animations
 Live price updates with dynamic summaries
 Checkout experience with feedback validation
 Smooth navigation and user interactions


Use Case	Implemented (Yes/No)	Demonstration / Notes
Example: User logs in and makes a reservation	Yes	Implemented using secure session handling. Demo at 2:45 in the video.
Example: Admin deletes resources	No	Not prioritized, possible future work.
Add explanations for each use case, including demo timestamps if using video.

✍️ Technical implementation
Frontend: Built with React, using TypeScript for type safety and maintainability, and styled using Tailwind CSS for fast, responsive design.
Backend: Implemented with Supabase, providing authentication, real-time database updates, and API services seamlessly.
Database: Powered by PostgreSQL, enabling structured and relational data storage for events, users, and bookings.
Deployment: Application deployed and hosted via Netlify, ensuring continuous deployment and scalability.
Architecture Decisions: Modular component-based structure in React, separating UI elements, data services, and business logic for better maintainability.

☀️ Reflection and future work
What worked well: Tailwind CSS greatly accelerated UI development. Vanilla JavaScript enabled flexible interactivity without heavy frameworks.
Challenges: Dynamically managing event modals and checkout summaries for different event types.
Future improvements: Add user authentication (sign up, login), and develop an admin panel to manage events dynamically from backend.
